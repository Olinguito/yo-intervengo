About Code
----------
Application's code uses ~~Angular.js 1.3~~ [Aurelia](http://aurelia.io) with ECMAScript 6 syntax and some [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/)
web components.<br>
HTML and stylesheets are written with [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/) and [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/)    
**WARNING!** The tools used here are way too *bleeding-edge*, you might get cut and bleed to death if you don't use google-chrome.
